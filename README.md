A simple create-react-app for Sundae

Challenges:

CSS takes quite sometime. So styling the page within 90 minutes was not easy. Had to think through the styling and each styled component needs to be styled appropriately. 

Improvements:

Wanted to add an animation to the image. If I had more time I would have added animation to make it look like the little character is walking.
